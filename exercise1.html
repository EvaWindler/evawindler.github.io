  <p id="title">HTML & CSS: Exercise 01</p>
  <h2>Directions</h2>
  <p>This page shows an example of very basic HTML with CSS applied to it. For this exercise, you will create:<br>
 <ol>
  <li>New text for your main document</li>
  <li>New p id's (6)</li>
  <li>New CSS for these p id's</li>
   <li>New text in your table</li>
   <li>New CSS for your table</li>
</ol>
The Helpful Tools on Canvas can be of assistance in knowing what the selectors, properties, and values mean. There are also tools for selecting your colors.<p>
  
Once you've completed these steps, you will submit the link to your CodePen and a copy of your complete .html document to Canvas.

   <p id="title">Awesome Songs!</p>
<p id="para1">These are some awesome songs you should know!</p>
  <!—I am of course an expert. -->
<p id="para2">Prepare yourself for awesomeness.</p>
<p id="para3">Songs are cool because they have emotions and are relatable and stuff! So are you ready? Really ready?<br/>
  (Say it louder)</p>
<p id="para4">Hmm, not quite believable yet! ARE YOU READY??</p>
<p id="para5">That's more like it! Let's get to it.</p>
  <p>
  <p id="para6"><a href='https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/awesomeness' target='_blank'>AWESOMENESS:</a></p>
 <div id='tablestuff'>
  <h2>For clarity, here's a table!</h2>
  <!—There are times when you may want to use the div instead of creating a table. Tables are the standard for tabular data, while div is used to define objects on the page and page layout. -->
  <p id="para7">Examples of awesome songs:</p>
   
   <table id="table">
  <tr>
    <th>Title</th>
    <th>Artist</th>
    <th>Why is it awesome?</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>"Francesca"</td>
    <td>Hozier</td>
    <td>A really cool ending with overlapping voices!</td>
    </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>"Little Talks"</td>
    <td>Of Monsters and Men</td>
    <td>It has a hidden meaning about a woman talking to her dead partner!</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>"Snap"</td>
    <td>Rosa Lynn</td>
    <td>It won 20th place in Eurovision! Trended on TikTok for a super long time.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

  <h2>Notes</h2>
  <!—I could also add notes in the comments. This is pretty common. -->
  We play all of these songs and more at <a href="https://wers.org" target="_blank">WERS</a>! There's also a cool app you can use to listen to it, or you can catch us on the radio in Boston at 88.9 WERS!<p>
  <p>You can also access all the songs I mentioned on Spotify! If you don't have an account yet, you should totally get one--it's cool!</p>
  <!—Who's awesome? I'm awesome. I made a beautiful code.-->
